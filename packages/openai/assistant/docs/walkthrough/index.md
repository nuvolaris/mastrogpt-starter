# CAEP walkthrough

In this series of walkthroughs, we'll delve into the CAEP (CodeArchitects Enterprise Platform) framework, a powerful toolset for developing robust and scalable applications. CAEP simplifies application development by automating many common tasks and providing a structured approach to building software. With CAEP, you can create microservices, define entities and APIs, set up data access layers, implement messaging and so on, in an efficient manner.

Our walkthroughs are designed to be beginner-friendly yet comprehensive, allowing you to grasp the framework's core concepts and gradually explore advanced features. Each guide takes you through a specific aspect of CAEP, providing step-by-step instructions, code examples, and real-world scenarios to illustrate its usage. Let's dive in and start building with CAEP!
